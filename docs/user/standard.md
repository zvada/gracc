# Standard GRACC Interfaces

## Grafana

[Grafana](http://grafana.org) is an open-source graphing/dashboarding web application,
widely used for system and service monitoring. The GRACC project maintains a Grafana 
deployment with a collection of standard dashboards at 
[https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org).

## Kibana

While Grafana is great for looking at pre-defined views into the data, it's not 
great for exploration or ad-hoc analytics, which is the area [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) excels in. The GRACC project maintains a public read-only
Kibana interface at 
[https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana).
